# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

After downloading the [zip file](https://github.com/spreadfire/InstantReplayXT/raw/master/precompiled/InstantReplay.zip), extract it to your *OBS install path* (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\obs-studio`). Keep the folder structure, as all files need to be extracted to their respective subdirectories.
